# RecommenderSystem - Machine Learning

Food Recommender System - To provide alternative food options which has similar nutritional values 

COVID-19 is an unforeseen scenario the world is currently facing. From loss of economy to the job crisis, 
and lack of supply of food products to the markets, weâ€™re facing problems on numerous fronts. 
During such a crisis situation, finding substitutions to certain food items might be a difficult task. 
In this project, we are building a recommender system based on content-based filtering for recommendation of 
food products as a substitute for the original product with same or nearly same dietary fulfillments.
